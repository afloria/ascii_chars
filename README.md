# ascii_chars
A project that shows how control flow works within Java.
The program first takes a string input from the user and sorts each character to see if
it is uppercase,lowercase,or number characters are located in the string.
Then the project asks for the user to enter their name and asks if they want
to continue to another part of the program that generates lottery ticket numbers.
The user can opt out of generating the lottery tickets. If the user does
generate lottery ticket numbers they are asked if they want to create another
set of lottery ticket numbers. If the user says yes, the lottery ticket generator runs again.
If the user says no, the program swiftly ends and thanks the user for utilizing the program.
